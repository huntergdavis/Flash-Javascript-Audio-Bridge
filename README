This is a basic flash to javascript audio in bridge.

Why do we need such a basic library, which is really little more than an SDK example?

I searched high and low out there, and found many examples on how to do flash to javascript audio in bridging, however not a single one of these examples provided a pre-compiled example for testing 

What about those of us who create and modify FFT algorithms for a living?  Why do we need to become experts in flash because the web consortium can't decide on an audio specification?

This is for those of us who don't want to set up a flash compiler and build system just to work with microphone data.
We all know that web audio in is coming soon, this library is just a crutch for the next few years while we settle out the spec.

For those of us who do want to edit the actionscript, mess with variables, write more functions etc, the source is there for that too.

Build.xml - A very simple build file for those who wish to compile this
FFTBridge.as - the actionscript source code which creates an audio-in bridge
FFTBridge.swf - the compiled above file

FFTBridge calls a javascript function you must provide, currently named stageOneFFT
FFTBridge supports callback from java --
